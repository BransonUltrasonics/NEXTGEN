/*
This layer holds the custom system call definition files which are used to
add the customer-provided system calls to the system call infrastructure used
by RTPs.
This default layer is essentially empty but is meant to be the source of
derived layers created by customers.

A derived layer must have an updated version number starting above 1.9.9.9 and
be selected in a VSB configuration to take effect.

Note: the two lower version digits are reserved for customer's usage and the
      two upper version digits are reserved for Wind River.
