#This document will describe the automated jtag build creation

Software installation in Builder4 VM
-> samba, samba-client, cifs-utils
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaClientGuide

ubuntu fstab modification:
location :/etc/fstab

added entry:
//buc-dan-fs-04/swlab /media/samba_share cifs username=builder4,domain=EMRSN,password=Freeway4,uid=nobody,iocharset=utf8,noperm 0 0

Note: password need to be update if it changed in builder4


Builder 4 script path: /home/builder4/jtag_build
#Command Template:
./jtag_build.sh <Version no> <relative path build share path after \\buc-dan-fs-04\SWLAB\BuildArchive\NextGen till firmware upgrade binary folder>


#For building jtag build 
./jtag_build.sh 1.0.6 Staging/Integration/DailyBuilds/Build_1.0.6/Binaries/Debug_FirmwareUpgrade

#For building jtag build with crc
./jtag_build.sh 1.0.6 Staging/Integration/DailyBuilds/Build_1.0.6/Binaries/Debug_FirmwareUpgrade

#This will copy the firmware upgrade image from share path and create a jtag binary for all three board 


#IF bootloader change required:
bootloader are part of sources code

 To change bootloader you have to create bootloader header file using bin2header utility and copy to source

bin2header location:/home/builder4/jtag_build

#command to convert to header file:

#For master:
./bin2header MLO
./bin2header u-boot.img

above command will create MLO.h and uboot.h header file, copy this to master source code

Master source location:/home/builder4/jtag_build/AM5728/flash_tool
qspi :  normal build
qspi_crc : crc build

after copy the header file run the jtag_build script for normal build or crc build

For Slave:
./bin2header u-boot.bin

above command will create uboot.h header file, copy this to slave source code

Slave source location: /home/builder4/Workspace_Jtag
Jtag_tool : normal build
Jtag_tool_crc : crc build

after copy the header file run the jtag_build script for normal build or crc build


Output:
After running the jtag build the output folder get created in 

#for build 1.0.6
Standard build: /home/builder4/jtag_build/jtag_flasher_L2_1.0.6
crc build: 	/home/builder4/jtag_build/jtag_flasher_L2_1.0.6_crc


Note: porting same script to other sytem will requires changes in source, pdk path change in the script
	script is only created for builder 4 environment.
